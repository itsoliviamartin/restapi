# REST API Go Lang

This an example REST API built with Go lang that represents a list of ablums. A GET request to the endpoint /inventory returns all of the albums within the list. A POST request to the endpoint /albums creates a new album and adds it to the inventory. A GET request to the endpoint /albums:id gets the album with the id passed as the path parameter. A GET request to the endpoint /albums gets the album based on the query parameters of the id, price, artist, or title that the client sends in the request.
